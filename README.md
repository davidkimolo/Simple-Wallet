SIMPLE BITCOIN WALLET DOCUMENTATION

INTRODUCTION
This is a simple bitcoin wallet application that can help those who are getting started
with bitcoin programming using python.
In this project I use python version 3.6 and Pycharm.
File free to fork the code or clone it for your own specific purposes.
Libraries and Dependencies
To use this script, you will require some libraries and dependencies. Install pip 3 so that
it can be easier for you to get them through the command prompt.
1. Pip install bitcoin
2. Pip install blockcypher
3. Pip install blockchain
4. Pip install coinbase
5. Pip install nexmo
6. Pip install json
7. Pip install csv
After installing the above mentioned now you are ready to go.
I started out the program by Making a user login system first, this is just an easy way to
authenticate like GUI wallets if the person login in is the owner of the wallet. The login
system is very simple and more features can be added to it like user registration, saving
password to a file or database e.t.c .
Note: Username= Can be anything you choose
Password = Password (This can be changed)
After correct login Login you are presented by the main menu where you can choose
from the list which operation you want to do.
This is what the menu contains:
1. Generating a private key
2. Generating a Public Key
3. Generating a Bitcoin Address
4. Generating a Bitcoin Multisig Address
5. Check Bitcoin Balance
6. Hashing of addresses (Pretty much anything)
7. Send bitcoins to another Address
8. Push Transactions to Blockchain
9. Send Bitcoin Information to Email
10. Send Bitcoin Transactions to Email
11. Send phone Notification with details
